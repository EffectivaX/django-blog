          Are you tired of being manipulated and taken advantage of? Do you
  sometimes feel you're not being listened to and don't get the respect
  and cooperation that you deserve? If you've ever wanted the ability
  to take control of every conversation and situation, now you've got it.
  Why go through life letting others lead you, when you can use the
  greatest psychological secrets to make things go your way. . . get
  anyone to do anything . . . and never feel powerless again!
  Here, you enter a world where psychology reigns and detecting
  deceit, changing a person's mind, or controlling a situation are re-
  duced to an easy-to-follow formula—a series of simple techniques
  and tactics.
        </p>
<p>
  You will be able to use the most complete and advanced psycho-
  logical strategies to enable your mind to become your greatest
  weapon. Most exciting, you should know that we're not talking about
  "tricks" that work sometimes on some people. This book contains only
  specific psychological tactics governing human behaviour that will
  let you outsmart, outthink, and outmanoeuvre. . . anyone,
  anyplace, anytime. These are carefully formulated tactics based on
  specific psychological principles and can be applied to any situation.
  Imagine how easy life would be if you were able to predict and
  control the outcome of any encounter. And instead of wondering
  what was going to happen, you applied proven, fast-working psycho-
  logical tactics to gain complete and total cooperation from all people
  in any situation.

<p>
  Have you ever asked someone to help you out and much to your
  surprise she happily obliged? Or perhaps you wanted to make a
  good impression and the person found you completely irresistible?
  You wonder if it was luck, the person's mood, or the situation—when
  in actuality you likely applied principles that govern human
  behaviour without even knowing it. The good news is that you can
  duplicate those same responses, systematically, any time you want,
  with anyone.
</p>

<p>
  To make it easy for you to learn how to apply these psychological
  secrets, the book is divided into forty mini-chapters, each governing
  various real-life situations. And best of all, once you become familiar
  with the psychological principles, you'll see that you can use the
  techniques to be successful anytime, in any situation that you find
  yourself in.
</p>

<p>
  Get ready to make life easy and have things go your way, when
  you . . . Get Anyone to Do Anything . . . and Never Feel Powerless
  Again!
